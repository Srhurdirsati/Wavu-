# August 22th: AAH ! This CAD WORK IS PATHETIC WITH MY POTATO PC [i2 2100 without any gpu , it took too much time to complete this] [14.5 HOURS]

Not Funny Bruh !  I Am Working On A Potato PC Without Any Gpu So Its Too Timetaking To Make A Small Project (Too Small). After All , I Started To Make It Earlier AS as I Made The PCB , But Decided To Make Just PCb . Uhh ! Now Decicded To Make A Case Too ! This Total Took Soo Mush Of My Time Like 6 Hours Earlier {Including Plannig For The Case } And Like 5 Hours Tommorrow To Design The Bottom {I Made It 3 Times , First - 8 Screw , Second - 4 Screws And 1 Double Sided Tape , Third - Just 2 Tapes To Make It Portable Too} And Today Like 3 Hours !! 


Steps To Make The Case - [FREECAD]
> I Have First Made Measurements In My Rough Notebook
> Design The Bottom Case First , take 5mm more than your pcb x and y , make a rectangle with that size , Close Sketch And Use Pad[offset] to make your sketch 3d
> Select the top face of rectangle after pad operation and make another sjetch of a rectangle of the same size as of your pcb , make mount holes if you want (I Opeted For Double Sided Strong Tape)
> YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DESIGNED YOUR BOTTOM PART OF THE CASE
> NOW YOU HAVE TO DESIGN THE TOP PART OF YOUR CASE
> Start by making a brnad new sketch of a rectangle same as the size of your case (The First Rectangle Which You Have Made Of +5mm Each :D)
> Close Sketch And Make It 3D Using Pad Operation
> YOU COMPLETED YOUR TOP TOO COMPLETING FULL 3D DESIGN !! Yayy :D.....

I AM NEW TO CAD <- THE REASON FOR TAKING SO MUCH TIME , BUT I LEARNT TOO MUCH NOW , WOULDN'T TAKE MUCH TIME FROM NEXT TIME
